A simple static website to display a gallery of images.

## How to use

1.  Add your image files to the `/images` directory.
2.  Open `js/script.js`.
3.  Add the filenames of your images to the `images` array.

For example:
```javascript
const images = [
    'my-first-photo.jpg',
    'another-cool-pic.png',
];
```

4.  Open `index.html` in your browser to see the gallery.
